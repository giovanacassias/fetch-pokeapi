# PokeAPI Project

<p>This is a project to practice and study DOM manipulation, fetch API, CSS, JavaScript, and important programming fundaments. Currently, I'm working only with the mobile version so the web version is not the focus at the moment.</p>

<p> Take a look on how the project is so far</p>
